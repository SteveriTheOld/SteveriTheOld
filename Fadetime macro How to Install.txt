ChamSys MagicQ Fadetime Macros


Place the file in your normal show folder.

Open the file in MagicQ.

Check that the macros in the file are not interfering with other macros.

Move macros if necessary.

Import your normal .SET settings file on top of the fadetime file.

Save your settings.

Adjust timings by going into view data of a macro on the macro page.

Make more macros with multiple timings simply by copying the macro and editing values on one.

Triggering from macro view works, also from the quick macros.

If you want these on buttons on an Execute screen you must make a cuestack on your Execute.

In said cuestack trigger the macro with B followed by the corresponding macro number.


If you find bugs etc let me know.
